<h1 align="center"> SAS Global Forum 2020 Analysis </h1>

The goal is to assist making decisions on invited speakers

For this following analysis would be done:
1) Text mining the YouTube data. Read over the comments and identify themes and patterns. Top words, words associated with popular presentations, and phrases associated with popular presentations.
2) SAS Community comments - A conversation among among a few people active on SAS community boards will be very helpful in identifying common questions and top subjects and speakers. 
3) Emerging Trends: while the first two look at historical data, this task will look forward to identify emerging issues that could help in making the decision on the speakers as well.
